1. Every function should be preceded by a comment describing the function's purpose.

2. Add a comment right to the line containing the right brace, }, that closes every function, including main.

3. Indent the entire body of each function one level of indentation within the braces that define tha body of the function,
This indentation emphasises the functional structure of the programs and helps make them easier to read.

4. Set a convetion for the indentation size you prefer and then uniformly apply that convetion.

5. Choosing meaningful variable names helps to make a program self-documenting---that is, fewer comments are needed.

6. The first letter of an identifier used as simple variable name should be a lowercase letter.
Later in the text we'll assign special significance to identifier that begin with a capital letter and to identifier that use all capital letter.
